# Hypereval

Hypereval allows you to evaluate Hyperlambda from within your browser, having it executed
on the server. It also allows you to create Hyperlambda pages, and startup objects, arguably
giving you an environment for creating your apps, having its Hypereval snippets becoming both 
its Controllers and its Views. Pages would be the equivalent of _"Views"_ - While startup objects, 
and/or other snippets, would become the equivalent of your _"Controllers"_.

## Installation

Hypereval is automatically installed when you install Phosphorus Five.

## License

Hypereval is free and open source software, and licensed under the terms
of the Gnu Public License, version 3, in addition to that a proprietary enabling license is available for a fee.
