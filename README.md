# Hypereval - A terminal module for Phosphorus Five

Hypereval allows you to evaluate Hyperlambda from within your browser, having it executed
on the server. It allows you to type in any Hyperlambda you wish, and have it evaluated on
the server.

It also allows you to inspect the code after it has been evaluated, to such more easily 
understand what the results of your Hyperlambda evaluation is.
