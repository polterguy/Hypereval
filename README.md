# Hypereval

Hypereval allows you to evaluate Hyperlambda from within Phosphorus Five, having it evaluated
on the server. It also allows you to create Hyperlambda pages, and startup objects, arguably
giving you an environment for creating your apps, having its Hypereval snippets becoming both
its Controllers and its Views.
