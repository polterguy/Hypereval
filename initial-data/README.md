## Initial snippets to import during startup

All Hyperlambda files in this folder, will be initially imported during startup, if there exists
no existing "snippets" in your database. This allows you to distribute Hypereval with a bunch
of pre-existing snippets, and have them automatically imported during the initial startup.
