  innerValue:@"Hypereval is a module that allows you to evaluate Hyperlambda in <em>'immediate'</em> mode. These parts of the documentation
expects you to understand at least some basic Hyperlambda, which you can probably pick up in a couple of hours
by reading through the <em>'Hyperlambda'</em> section of the documentation."

p
  innerValue:@"Hypereval also allows you to store <em>'snippets'</em> of Hyperlambda in your MySQL database, making
your snippets easily evailable from any app, and such provides a database of Hyperlambda snippets, which
you can consume and easily manage from your own apps."

p
  innerValue:@"Hypereval is particularly useful when combined with for instance the Magic Menu, since this
combination allows you to separate your concerns - AKA; UI and implementation. It is also highly useful
for performing administrative tasks, by tapping into the API of the different modules, to for instance
create backups, etc. You can think of it as the <em>'terminal windows'</em> of Phosphorus Five."
